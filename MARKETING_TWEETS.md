## Feature Highlight Tweets

### Tweet 4: Privacy Focus
```
Your task manager knows:
• What you're working on
• When you work
• How you prioritize
• Your personal projects

Question: Should a company have access to all that?

Our answer: No. That's why we built a Kanban board that keeps your data LOCAL.

Ours adapts to YOURS.

→ Create unlimited custom columns

→ From simple TODO to complex workflows

No limits. No subscription tiers.

## Educational/Value Tweets

### Tweet 8: Kanban Explainer
```
What is Kanban? 🤔

A visual system for managing work:

1️⃣ Visualize your workflow (columns)
2️⃣ Limit work in progress (focus)
3️⃣ Manage flow (move cards)

Born at Toyota, now used by teams worldwide.

Want to try it? We made it easy: [LINK]

```

### Tweet 9: Productivity Tip
```
Productivity tip: Limit your "In Progress" column

Why?
→ Context switching kills productivity
→ Finishing > Starting
→ Better to complete 3 tasks than start 10

Our Kanban board makes this visual. You'll see when you're overcommitted.

```

### Tweet 10: Privacy Education
```
"I have nothing to hide, why care about privacy?"

Your task manager data reveals:
• Work patterns
• Project ideas
• Personal goals
• Mental health (when tasks pile up)
• Side hustles

Privacy isn't about hiding. It's about CONTROL.

## Behind-the-Scenes Tweets

### Tweet 11: Builder Story
```
Why I built a Kanban board when Trello exists:

1. Got tired of creating accounts
2. Wanted my data local, not in a database
3. Noticed most tools are bloated
4. Thought "how hard could it be?"

Turns out, pretty fun. Here's what I made:

```

### Tweet 13: Design Philosophy
```
Design principle: Make the right thing easy

❌ Don't make users think about columns
✅ Start with TODO, In Progress, Done

❌ Don't hide the delete button behind 3 menus
✅ Hover to delete (but protect default columns)

❌ Don't require save buttons
✅ Auto-save everything instantly

### Tweet 17: The Middle Path
```
Kanban board spectrum:

← Post-it notes → Jira enterprise →

We're right in the middle:

• More digital than sticky notes
• Way simpler than Jira
• Better UX than spreadsheets

## Thread Series

### Thread 1: "Why Local Storage?"
```
Tweet 1/5:
Why does our Kanban board use local storage instead of a database?

Thread on privacy-first architecture 👇

Tweet 2/5:
Local storage = your data never leaves your device

No servers to hack. No databases to breach. No "accidental" data leaks.

If you clear your browser, it's gone. True data ownership.

Tweet 3/5:
"But what about backups?"

Fair point. We're adding export/import soon.

Download your data as JSON, keep backups wherever you want. YOUR data, YOUR control.

Tweet 4/5:
"What about collaboration?"

Currently best for individuals/small teams on same device.

Future: Optional P2P sync (no central server) or self-hosted backend.

Privacy-first doesn't mean feature-last.

Tweet 5/5:
Tech is moving toward local-first software:

→ Less server dependency
→ Works offline
→ Faster (no network latency)
→ More private

We're betting on this future.

### Thread 2: "Building a Kanban Board"
```
Tweet 1/7:
Built a production-ready Kanban board in a weekend.

Here's how (and what I learned) 🧵

Tweet 2/7:
Tech stack:
• Next.js 14 (App Router)
• TypeScript
• Tailwind CSS
• @dnd-kit for drag-and-drop
• Framer Motion for animations

Why these? Speed + DX + small bundle size.

Tweet 3/7:
Drag-and-drop was the hardest part.

Tried react-beautiful-dnd (deprecated)
Tried react-dnd (too complex)
Used @dnd-kit (perfect balance)

Accessibility + touch support + keyboard nav = 10/10

Tweet 4/7:
State management: just React hooks

No Redux, no Zustand, no Context hell.

useState + useEffect + custom useLocalStorage hook.

Sometimes vanilla React is enough.

Tweet 5/7:
Animations with Framer Motion:

Cards slide in/out, drag feedback, modal springs.

~10KB added to bundle, huge improvement in feel.

Motion design = the difference between "functional" and "delightful"

Tweet 6/7:
LocalStorage persistence:

JSON.stringify/parse with error handling.
Auto-save on every change.
Restore on page load.

No backend needed. Users loved it.

Tweet 7/7:
Result: ~150KB bundle, instant load, smooth as butter.

Open source on GitHub.

What should I build next?
