### Email 2: Power User Tips (Day 3)
**Subject:** 5 ways to level up your Kanban board 🚀

**Preview Text:** Most people miss these workflow tips

**Body:**

---

Hey there,

Been using the Kanban board for a few days? Here are some power user tips to make it even better:

**1. Limit Your "In Progress" Column**
   → Only 3-5 tasks max
   → Forces focus, reduces context-switching
   → You'll finish more, start less

**2. Use Descriptive Card Titles**
   → ❌ "Website stuff"
   → ✅ "Write hero section copy for homepage"
   → Future you will thank present you

**3. Create Custom Columns for Your Workflow**
   → Not everything is TODO → In Progress → Done
   → Try: Backlog → This Week → Building → Testing → Done
   → Match YOUR process

**4. Weekly Review Ritual**
   → Sunday night: review all cards
   → Archive completed work
   → Plan next week's priorities
   → 15 minutes = clarity for the week

**5. The "Notes" Field is Your Friend**
   → Click any card to add details
   → Requirements, links, thoughts
   → Keep context close to the task

**Try one of these today:**

### Email 3: The Privacy Story (Day 7)
**Subject:** Why we built a task manager with zero data collection

**Preview Text:** It's about control, not hiding

**Body:**

---

Hey there,

Let me tell you why we built this differently.

Most productivity apps collect your data. They say it's to "improve the experience" or "provide better features."

But here's what they actually learn:
- What projects you're working on
- When you're most productive
- What you struggle with
- Your career ambitions
- Your side hustle ideas

**That's... a lot of information about you.**

Some companies sell it. Others get hacked. Sometimes it's subpoenaed.

We took a different approach:

**Your tasks never leave your browser.**

No servers to hack. No databases to breach. No "privacy policy updates" because there's nothing to update.

Your data lives on YOUR device. If you clear your browser, it's gone. True ownership.

**"But what about backups?"**

Great question. We're adding export/import soon. You'll download your data, back it up wherever you want.

YOUR data. YOUR control. YOUR business.

**Is this the right choice for everyone?**

Honestly? No.

If you need cloud sync across 5 devices and real-time team collaboration, use Trello or Notion. They're great tools.

But if you value:
- Privacy over convenience
- Simplicity over features
- Control over automation

Then we built this for you.

## Educational Content Emails

### Email 8: Kanban 101
**Subject:** Kanban 101: Master the basics in 5 minutes

**Preview Text:** From Toyota factories to your workflow

**Body:**

---

Hey there,

Ever wondered where Kanban came from? Quick history lesson:

**1940s: Toyota Factory**
Workers used cards ("kanban" in Japanese) to signal when to build more parts.

Visual. Simple. Effective.

**2000s: Software Teams**
Developers adapted it for managing code tasks.

**Today: Everyone**
Writers, designers, students, freelancers - anyone with work to manage.

**THE THREE PRINCIPLES:**

**1. Visualize Your Work**
→ If you can see it, you can manage it
→ Cards = tasks, Columns = stages
→ Board = your entire workflow at a glance

**2. Limit Work In Progress**
→ Doing less = finishing more
→ Too many "in progress" tasks = context switching hell
→ Keep your "In Progress" column small (3-5 tasks max)

**3. Manage Flow**
→ Watch how tasks move across the board
→ Where do they get stuck?
→ Optimize the bottlenecks

**TRY IT YOURSELF:**

Open your board and try this exercise:

1. Create 3 columns: "To Do", "Doing", "Done"
2. Add 5 tasks you need to complete this week
3. Move only 1-2 to "Doing"
4. Don't start a new task until you finish one

Notice the difference? You'll actually complete things.

Keep flowing,
[Your name]

### Email 9: Comparison Guide
**Subject:** Choosing a task manager: A honest comparison

**Preview Text:** Trello vs Notion vs Our Board vs Pen & Paper

**Body:**

---

Hey there,

Let's be real: there are a million task managers out there.

So why choose ours? When should you NOT choose it?

Here's an honest comparison:

**📋 TRELLO**

Best for: Teams, visual collaboration
Pros: Mobile apps, integrations, established
Cons: Requires signup, cloud storage, freemium limits

Choose Trello if: You need mobile apps and team features

**📝 NOTION**

Best for: All-in-one workspace (docs + tasks + wiki)
Pros: Incredibly flexible, databases, templates
Cons: Steep learning curve, can be slow, requires account

Choose Notion if: You want docs, databases, and tasks in one place

**✅ TODOIST**

Best for: Simple task lists with deadlines
Pros: Fast, clean, cross-platform
Cons: Not visual, requires account, limited in free tier

Choose Todoist if: You prefer lists over boards

**📌 OUR KANBAN BOARD**

Best for: Privacy-focused individuals, small teams
Pros: No signup, local storage, beautiful UI, free forever
Cons: No mobile app (yet), no cloud sync, no collaboration features

Choose ours if: You value privacy and simplicity over features

**📝 PEN & PAPER**

Best for: Tactile learners, digital detox
Pros: No batteries, no tracking, satisfying to cross things off
Cons: Can't search, no backups, hard to reorganize

Choose pen & paper if: You're going analog (respect)

**THE TRUTH:**

The best tool is the one you'll actually use.

Try a few. See what sticks. Don't overthink it.

**Want to try ours?**
[Open the board] - no signup, no commitment

Happy organizing,
[Your name]

P.S. Using multiple tools is fine too. I use our board for projects and Todoist for quick tasks. Do what works for YOU.

**Preview Text:** Open source, TypeScript, self-hostable

**Body:**

→ MIT license (do whatever you want)
→ TypeScript + Next.js 14
→ Clean architecture, easy to understand

**SELF-HOSTABLE**

→ Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or your own server
→ Your data, your infrastructure

**HACKABLE**
→ Want to add features? Fork it.
→ Want to change colors? Edit the Tailwind config.
→ Want to add a backend? We designed for that.

**TECH STACK:**
```
Next.js 14 (App Router)
TypeScript (strict mode)
Tailwind CSS
@dnd-kit (drag-and-drop)
Framer Motion (animations)
Local Storage API
```

**FOR YOUR WORKFLOW:**

### Email 12: For Privacy Advocates
**Subject:** A task manager that respects your digital rights

**Preview Text:** Zero tracking. Zero data collection. Zero compromises.

**Body:**

---

Hey there,

You care about privacy. You read privacy policies. You use Signal, not WhatsApp.

So why are you giving your task data to cloud companies?

**YOUR TASK MANAGER KNOWS:**
- What projects you're working on
- When you're most productive
- What you struggle with
- Your side hustle ideas
- Your career plans

**MOST TOOLS:**
→ Store this in their database
→ "Anonymize" it (but keep some identifiers)
→ Use it for "product improvements"
→ Sometimes sell it to third parties

**OUR APPROACH:**

**Zero Collection**
→ No servers
→ No database
→ No analytics
→ No tracking pixels

**Local Storage Only**
→ Data lives in your browser
→ Never sent anywhere
→ Clear your cache = data gone
→ True ownership

**Open Source**
→ Don't trust us? Read the code.
→ Audit it yourself
→ No hidden telemetry

**TRADE-OFFS (being honest):**

✅ Complete privacy
✅ Works offline
✅ Fast (no network calls)

❌ No cloud sync (yet - exploring P2P)
❌ No mobile app (responsive web only)
❌ No team features (single-device for now)

**IS THIS FOR YOU?**

If you value privacy over convenience: Yes.
If you need multi-device sync: Not yet.

**Try the most private task manager:**
[Open board]

Your data. Your device. Your rights.
